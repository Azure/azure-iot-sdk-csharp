### Prerequisites
In order to run the device samples on Linux or Windows, you will first need the following prerequisites:
* [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
* [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-device]

### Setup environment

The following prerequisite is the minimum requirement to build and run the samples. 

Visual Studio is **not required** to run the samples.

- Install the latest .NET Core from https://dot.net

### Get and run the samples
You need to clone the repository or download the sample (the one you want to try) project's folder on your device.

#### Build and run the samples:
1. Preparing the sample application:
   1. Set the following environment variables on the terminal from which you want to run the application.

      * IOTHUB_DEVICE_CONNECTION_STRING

2. Building the sample application:

    To build the sample application using dotnet, from terminal navigate to the sample folder (where the .csproj file lives). Then execute the following command and check for build errors:

    ```
    dotnet build
    ```

3. Running the sample application:

	To run the sample application using dotnet, execute the following command.

    ```
    dotnet run
    ```
