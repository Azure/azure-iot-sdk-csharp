# Microsoft Azure IoT device SDK for .NET

This folder contains the following
* The Microsoft Azure IoT device SDK for .NET to facilitate building devices and applications that connect to and are managed by Azure IoT Hub services.
* Documentation and samples to help you get started using this SDK.

The library is available as a NuGet package for you include in your own development projects.

## Features
 * Sends event data to Azure IoT based services.
 * Maps server commands to device functions.
 * Batches messages to improve communication efficiency.
 * Supports pluggable transport protocols.

## Application development guidelines
For information on how to use this library refer to the documents below:
- [How to use the Azure IoT SDKs for .NET][how-to-use]

### Using client SDK in [Azure Functions][azure-functions]
Azure Function doesn't currently support [bindingRedirect][binding-redirect] **element**

**Example**

```
<dependentAssembly>
        <assemblyIdentity name="Validation" publicKeyToken="2fc06f0d701809a7" culture="neutral" />
        <bindingRedirect oldVersion="0.0.0.0-2.2.0.0" newVersion="2.2.0.0" />
</dependentAssembly>
```

So **workaround** would be to directly install older version of **validation.dll** using [project.json][project-json] covered under [Package management][package-management] 

**Example**

```
{
"frameworks": {
    "net46":{
        "dependencies": {
            "Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Client": "1.1.1",
             "Validation": "2.0.6.15003"
                    }
                }
        }
}
```
