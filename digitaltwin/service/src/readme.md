# Autorest config file for generating Digital Twin Service Client models and protocol layer

# From command prompt, simpy run "autorest" from this folder and it will pick up this config file and output the results into this folder
# There is a powershell script that should be used instead. This is because there are a few other automated changes that should happen after running autorest
