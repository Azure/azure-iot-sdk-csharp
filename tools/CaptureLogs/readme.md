# Capturing Traces

## Windows
On Windows logman or PerfView can be used to collect traces. For more information please see https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/workflow/debugging/libraries/windows-instructions.md#traces

We have provided the following convenience scripts for log collection using `logman`.

1. Launch Powershell with administrator privileges.
2. To start capturing traces, invoke `iot_startlog.ps1`.
   1. Pass in the following required parameters:
      1. `-TraceName` - the name of the event trace data collector.  This can be any name that will be used to identity the collector created.
      2. `-Output` - the output log file that will be created. This should be a `.etl` file.
      3. `-ProviderFile` - The file listing multiple Event Trace providers to enable. The file should be a text file containing one provider per line.
        The Azure IoT SDK providers file is present [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/blob/master/tools/CaptureLogs/iot_providers.txt). The providers list with their corresponding package details are present [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/tree/master/tools/CaptureLogs#azure-iot-sdk-providers).

  Sample usage:

  To create an event trace data collector called `IotTrace`, using the file `iot_providers.txt` for the list of event providers to be enabled, putting the results in a file `iot.etl` in the same folder from where the command is invoked, type:
  ```powersehll
  .\iot_startlog.ps1 -Output iot.etl -ProviderFile .\iot_providers.txt -TraceName IotTrace
  ```

3. To stop capturing traces, invoke `iot_stoplog.ps1`.
   1. Pass in the following required parameter:
      1. `-TraceName` - the name of the event trace data collector. Same as the one used while starting trace capture.

  Sample usage:
  ```powersehll
   .\iot_stoplog.ps1 -TraceName IotTrace
  ```

## Linux
On Linux and OSX LTTNG and perfcollect can be used to collect traces. For more information please see https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/linux-performance-tracing.md

## Console logging
Logging can be added to console. Note that this method will substantially slow down execution.

  1. Add [`e2e\test\helpers\ConsoleEventListener.cs`](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/blob/master/e2e/test/helpers/ConsoleEventListener.cs) to your project.
  2. Instantiate the listener. Add one or more filters (e.g. `Microsoft-Azure-` or `DotNetty-`):

```csharp
	private static readonly ConsoleEventListener _listener = new ConsoleEventListener();
```
> NOTE: 
> 1. `static` fields are optimized for runtime performance and are initialized prior to their first usage. If `_listener` is the only static field initialized in your class, you'll need to provide a static constructor that initializes them when the class is loaded.
> 2. `ConsoleEventListener.cs` logs the following events by default. If you want to log specific event providers, modify the [event filter](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/blob/4b5e0147f3768761cacaf4913ab6be707425f9da/e2e/test/helpers/ConsoleEventListener.cs#L20) list to include only your desired event providers.
> ```csharp
> private static readonly string[] s_eventFilter = new string[] { "DotNetty-Default", "Microsoft-Azure-Devices", "Azure-Core", "Azure-Identity" };
> ```
