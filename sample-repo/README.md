# Azure IoT Samples for C# (.NET)

azure-iot-samples-csharp provides a set of easy-to-understand, continuously-tested samples for connecting to Azure IoT Hub via Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp.

## Prerequisites

- .NET Core SDK 3.0.0 or greater on your development machine.  You can download the .NET Core SDK for multiple platforms from [.NET](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/all).  You can verify the current version of C# on your development machine using 'dotnet --version'.

  **Note:** The samples can be compiled using the NET Core SDK 2.1 SDK if the language version of projects using C# 8 features are changed to `preview`.

## Preview features

Samples showing how to use the various preview features of Microsoft Azure IoT .NET SDK are present [here](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-iot-samples-csharp/tree/preview).
