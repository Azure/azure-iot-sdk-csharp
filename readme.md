# Microsoft Azure IoT SDK for .NET

### Contents

This repository contains the following:

- **Microsoft Azure IoT Hub device SDK for C#** to connect client devices to Azure IoT Hub with .NET.
- **Microsoft Azure IoT Hub service SDK for C#** to manage your IoT Hub service instance from a back-end .NET application.
- **Microsoft Azure Provisioning device SDK for C#** to provision devices to Azure IoT Hub with .NET.
- **Microsoft Azure Provisioning service SDK for C#** to manage your Provisioning service instance from a back-end .NET application.

## Critical Upcoming Change Notice

All Azure IoT SDK users are advised to be aware of upcoming TLS certificate changes for Azure IoT Hub and Device Provisioning Service 
that will impact the SDK's ability to connect to these services. In October 2022, both services will migrate from the current 
[Baltimore CyberTrust CA Root](https://baltimore-cybertrust-root.chain-demos.digicert.com/info/index.html) to the 
[DigiCert Global G2 CA root](https://global-root-g2.chain-demos.digicert.com/info/index.html). There will be a 
transition period beforehand where your IoT devices must have both the Baltimore and Digicert public certificates 
installed in their certificate store in order to prevent connectivity issues. 

**Devices with only the Baltimore public certificate installed will lose the ability to connect to Azure IoT hub and Device Provisioning Service in October 2022.**

To prepare for this change, make sure your device's certificate store has both of these public certificates installed.

For a more in depth explanation as to why the IoT services are doing this, please see
[this article](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/internet-of-things/azure-iot-tls-critical-changes-are-almost-here-and-why-you/ba-p/2393169).

> Note:  
> 1. In addition to stable builds we also release pre-release builds that contain preview features. You can find details about the preview features released by looking at the [release notes](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/releases). It is not recommended to take dependency on preview NuGets for production applications as breaking changes can be introduced in preview packages.
> 2. Device streaming feature is not being included in our newer preview releases as there is no active development going on in the service. For more details on the feature, see [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-device-streams-overview).
>  
>       This feature has not been included in any preview release after [2020-10-14](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/releases/tag/preview_2020-10-14). However, the feature is still available under [previews/deviceStreaming branch](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/tree/previews/deviceStreaming).  
>  
>       The latest preview NuGet versions that contain the device streaming feature are:  
        Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Client - 1.32.0-preview-001  
        Microsoft.Azure.Devices - 1.28.0-preview-001
> 3. Stable and preview NuGet versions are not interdependent; eg. for NuGet packages versioned 1.25.0 (stable release) and 1.25.0-preview-001 (preview release), there is no guarantee that v1.25.0 contains the feature(s) previewed in v1.25.0-preview-001. For a list of updates shipped with each NuGet package, please refer to the [release notes](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/releases).

### Provisioniong Service SDK

This repository contains [provisioning service client SDK](./provisioning/service/) for the Device Provisioning Service to [programmatically enroll devices](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-dps/how-to-manage-enrollments-sdks).

## Certificates -  Important to know

The Azure IoT Hub certificates presented during TLS negotiation shall be always validated using the appropriate root CA certificate(s).

Always prefer using the local system's Trusted Root Certificate Authority store instead of hardcoding the certificates. 

A couple of examples:

- Windows: Schannel will automatically pick up CA certificates from the store managed using `certmgr.msc`.
- Debian Linux: OpenSSL will automatically pick up CA certificates from the store installed using `apt install ca-certificates`. Adding a certificate to the store is described here: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man8/update-ca-certificates.8.html

### Additional Information

For additional guidance and important information about certificates, please refer to [this blog post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/internet-of-things/azure-iot-tls-changes-are-coming-and-why-you-should-care/ba-p/1658456) from the security team. 

# Long-Term Support (LTS)

The project offers a Long Term Support (LTS) version to allow users that do not need the latest features to be shielded from unwanted changes.

As of August 2020, the .NET SDK is shifting to a revised Long-Term Support strategy.
The primary motivations for this change are to extend the support period and decrease the churn on LTS releases, while still maintaining a strategy that offers customers choice between new features and stability.

We now will be releasing a new LTS branch yearly, and each LTS release will be supported for 3 years - 1 year of active maintenance with bugfixes, and 2 years of extended support for security fixes.

LTS branches receive all bug fixes that fall in one of these categories:

- security bugfixes
- critical bugfixes (crashes, memory leaks, etc.)

No new features or improvements will be picked up in an LTS branch. A patch will not extend the maintenance or expiry date.

LTS branches are named lts_*yyyy*_*mm*, where *mm* and *yyyy* are the month and year when the branch was created. An example of such a branch is *lts_2018_01*.

## Schedule<sup>1</sup>

Below is a table showing the mapping of the LTS branches to the packages released.
