## OS platforms and hardware compatibility

```diff
- .NET MicroFramework will not be supported in future versions of the SDK.
```

The IoT Hub device SDK for .NET can be used with a broad range of OS platforms and devices.

The NuGet packages provide support for the following .NET flavors:
- .NET Standard 2.0
- .NET Standard 1.3 (IoT Hub SDKs only)
- .NET Framework 4.5.1 (IoT Hub SDKs only)

For details on .NET support see the [.NET Standard documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard).

# Long Term Support

The project offers a Long Term Support (LTS) version to allow users that do not need the latest features to be shielded from unwanted changes.

A new LTS version will be created every 6 months. The lifetime of an LTS branch is currently planned for one year. LTS branches receive all bug fixes that fall in one of these categories:

- security bugfixes
- critical bugfixes (crashes, memory leaks, etc.)

No new features or improvements will be picked up in an LTS branch.

LTS branches are named lts_*yyyy*_*mm*, where *mm* and *yyyy* are the month and year when the branch was created. An example of such a branch is *lts_2018_01*.
