## Developing applications for Azure IoT

Visit [Azure IoT Dev Center][iot-dev-center] to learn more about developing applications for Azure IoT.

## Samples

Most of our samples are available at [Azure IoT Samples for C#](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-iot-samples-csharp).

If you are looking for a good device sample to get started with, please see the [device reconnection sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-iot-samples-csharp/tree/master/iot-hub/Samples/device/DeviceReconnectionSample).
It shows how to connect a device, handle disconnect events, cases to handle when making calls, and when to re-initialize the `DeviceClient`.

## Contribute to the Azure IoT C# SDK

If you would like to build or change the SDK source code, please follow the [devguide](doc/devguide.md).

## OS platforms and hardware compatibility

> .NET Standard 1.3 (IoT Hub SDKs only) is last supported in the [2020-02-27](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/releases/tag/2020-2-27) and in the [2020-1-31 LTS](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/releases/tag/lts_2020-1-31) releases.

## Certificates -  Important to know

The Azure IoT Hub certificates presented during TLS negotiation shall be always validated using the appropriate root CA certificate(s).

Always prefer using the local system's Trusted Root Certificate Authority store instead of hardcoding the certificates. 

A couple of examples:

- Windows: Schannel will automatically pick up CA certificates from the store managed using `certmgr.msc`.
- Debian Linux: OpenSSL will automatically pick up CA certificates from the store installed using `apt install ca-certificates`. Adding a certificate to the store is described here: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man8/update-ca-certificates.8.html

### Additional Information

For additional guidance and important information about certificates, please refer to [this blog post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/internet-of-things/azure-iot-tls-changes-are-coming-and-why-you-should-care/ba-p/1658456) from the security team. 

# Long-Term Support (LTS)

The project offers a Long Term Support (LTS) version to allow users that do not need the latest features to be shielded from unwanted changes.

As of August 2020, the .NET SDK is shifting to a revised Long-Term Support strategy.
The primary motivations for this change are to extend the support period and decrease the churn on LTS releases, while still maintaining a strategy that offers customers choice between new features and stability.

We now will be releasing a new LTS branch yearly, and each LTS release will be supported for 3 years - 1 year of active maintenance with bugfixes, and 2 years of extended support for security fixes.

LTS branches receive all bug fixes that fall in one of these categories:

- security bugfixes
- critical bugfixes (crashes, memory leaks, etc.)

No new features or improvements will be picked up in an LTS branch. A patch will not extend the maintenance or expiry date.

LTS branches are named lts_*yyyy*_*mm*, where *mm* and *yyyy* are the month and year when the branch was created. An example of such a branch is *lts_2018_01*.

## Schedule<sup>1</sup>

Below is a table showing the mapping of the LTS branches to the packages released.
